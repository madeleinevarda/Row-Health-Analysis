# Row Health Marketing Insights - Project Overview

Founded in 2016, Row Health is a medical insurance company serving thousands of customers throughout the United States. In 2019, they launched a new set of marketing campaign categories spanning topics like wellness tips, the affordability of their plans, and preventative care. 

Now that theyâ€™ve hired a new data team and are strategizing their marketing budget for the year, the company would like to build more understanding of the effectiveness of these campaign categories and how they relate to signups and subsequent patient claims.

# Executive Summary

Healthcare campaign performance analysis reveals "Health for All" as the standout program with a 2.94% signup rate, primarily driven by its Health Awareness campaign (3.72% signup rate). Post-pandemic trends show "Compare Health Coverage" and "Healthy Living" campaigns dominating customer acquisition, though "Compare Health Coverage" carries the highest average claim amount ($410) and has accumulated $3.9M in total claims. Significant spikes in both signup and claim metrics correlate with COVID-19 peaks, with April 2020 showing the most dramatic increases across most campaigns. Several underperforming programs, notably "Golden Years" (0.01% signup rate) and "Benefit Updates" (0.02% signup rate), require immediate evaluation or termination, while successful campaigns like "Healthy Living" present opportunities for expansion despite moderate costs per signup.

# Insights Summary

In order to evaluate campaign performance, we focused on the following key metrics:

* **Signup Rate:** The percent of people who see a campaign and subsequently sign up for a Row Health plan.
* **Cost per Signup:** The average dollars spent in order to acquire a signup from each campaign.
* **Click through Rate:** The percent of people who see a campaign and click on the associated link.

## Signup Rate 

* The Health Awareness Campaign was most successful in terms of overall signups (3,727). It consisted of two initiatives, "Healthy Living" with a 3.72% signup rate and 3,279 signups, and Product Promotion inititiative with a 0.82% signup rate and 266 signups.

* More resources should be strategically allocated to this successful campaign.
* Golden Years Program Concerns: This campaign is performing extremely poorly with a near-zero 0.01% signup rate, only 23 signups, and the highest cost at 124.1. The program either needs immediate radical restructuring or should be completely eliminated due to its ineffectiveness.
* Post-Pandemic Health Consciousness: Compare Health Coverage and Healthy Living campaigns dominate post-pandemic signup metrics, suggesting a potential shift in public attitude where people are more consciously caring about their health following the global COVID-19 pandemic.
* Seasonality Impact: Almost all campaigns experienced a significant signup spike in April 2020 during the peak of COVID-19, with some campaigns like Tailored Health Plans and Preventative Care Plans showing additional high peaks in subsequent months, potentially correlating with different COVID strains and healthcare concerns.
